# AE E. Coli Autoencoder Project

This project implements an **Autoencoder (AE)** model for analyzing **E. Coli** data. The Autoencoder is used to compress the data and then reconstruct it, with applications in data denoising, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction.

## Project Overview
This project uses an Autoencoder model to analyze and compress E. Coli data, specifically focusing on:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Encoding and normalizing input data.
- **Model Architecture**: Creating an Autoencoder with an encoder and decoder structure.
- **Training**: Using the processed data to train the Autoencoder model.
- **Evaluation**: Analyzing the model performance with loss plots and reconstruction error.

## Installation
To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the dependencies.
